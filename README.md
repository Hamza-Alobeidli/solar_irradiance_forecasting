# solar_irradiance_forecasting
1- First, setup environment from env.yml
2- Second, make sure that the notebooks (LSTM_Medford.ipynb, GRU_Medford.ipynb, Random_Forest_Medford.ipynb) and the datasets (.csv) are in the same directory
3- Then, you can start run LSTM_Medford.ipynb or GRU_Medford.ipynb models in any sequence
4- Last, run the Random_Forest_Medford.ipynb Model as it contain a comparison for all models.
5- Optional, folder Cross_Validation_for_best_hyper-prameters contains the Cross-Validation process to optain the best hyper-parameters. It could takes about a hour to finish.

## Note: The models LSTM_Medford.ipynb, and GRU_Medford.ipynb are built with the best hyper-parameters. In Random_Forest_Medford.ipynb, the GridSearch is done to obtain the best parameters.

Enjoy:)
